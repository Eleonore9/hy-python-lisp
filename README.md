### About Lisp

Formely LISP for "LISt Processor".

It was specified in 1958 which makes it the second oldest high-level programming
language still in use today (after Fortran).
Influenced by [lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus), Lisp was created as a practical mathematical notation for computer programs and became the most widely used language in artificial intelligence research.

Lisp syntax is characterised by parenthesized lists where the function is the first element and is followed by its arguments:
```
(function argument1 argument2)
```
Today several Lisp dialects are used for general purpose (web development, data engineering...); [Common Lisp](https://common-lisp.net/), [Scheme](http://www.schemers.org/), [Clojure](http://clojure.org/)... and Hy =)

### Intro to Hy

[Hy](https://github.com/hylang/hy) is a Lisp dialect that converts its structure to Python, allowing to explore Lisp within leaving the comfort of Python.

Willing to give it a go? You can [try Hy](https://try-hy.appspot.com/) in your browser!
It's as easy as `(print "hello world")`.
And calculations go from
```
(3.5 + 5.1 + 4.6) / 3
```
to
```
(/ (+ 3.5 5.1 4.6) 3)
```
Now use the [Quickstart](http://docs.hylang.org/en/latest/quickstart.html) guide to install Hy in a virtual environment and write your first Hy programme in a `.hy` file!

In Hy you have access to all of Python data structures and the standard library.

Example 1: for loop

```
=> (for [i (range 10)]
	(print (+ "Count is " (str i))))

Count is 0
Count is 1
Count is 2
Count is 3
Count is 4
Count is 5
Count is 6
Count is 7
Count is 8
Count is 9

```

Example 2: function definition

```
```
