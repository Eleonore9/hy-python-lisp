## An introduction to my `(= Hy (+ Python Lisp)) poster


### How did I come to make and present a poster about Hy?

*Tl;dr: I love both Python and Clojure so I like to share parens <3 with pythonistas.*

Although I've learned programming with Python and had first worked in the tech industry
in a Python role, I have now been working with Clojure for almost two years.

I'm quite comfortable writing Clojure code and find it similar to Python in how it favours
simplicity over complexity and is thus rather easy to read and write.

Clojure is a dialect of Lisp. It is also a functional programming (FP) language.
Due to the rise in use and trend in learning FP languages I thought some people would
be keen on knowing more about Clojure. They might also want to use it for personnal or
professional projects. For that reason sharing my experience with Clojure was the focus
of a [poster](https://github.com/Eleonore9/from-python-to-clojure) I presented at PyCon 2015 (and EuroPython 2015, and PyCon UK 2015).

During the poster session at PyCon last year several people mentioned Hy to me as this Lisp language that compiles to Python. I was excited and eager to try it! And while brainstorming for a poster to present at PyCon this year I thought sharing my experience learning Hy was an obvious choice.
I'm very happy my poster proposal was picked! Now I get to continue on sharing parens love =)
Because that's what it's about (in case you thought it was about converting people to FP and/or to Lisp).


### How do I like Hy?

*Tl;dr:* \ ^-^ / <- that's an happy emoticon, btw

Trying Hy was both a weird and pleasant experience.
Pleasant because I finally realised how elegant Lisp code is. And also because there are good tools available for Hy. Those happen to be very close to the tolls I use for Clojure daily so it made me feel at home!
Weird because my brain still struggles to associate Lisp syntax with Python code. I think learning a Lisp involves "telling" your brain this particular syntax is only to be associated with specific languages. But with I can pass data around using a threading but calling Python functions to transform that data.


### What are the main resources I used for this project?

*Tl;dr: [docs.hylang.org/en/latest/](http://docs.hylang.org/en/latest/)*

The README.md and poster have mostly been written with the help of the [Hy documentation](http://docs.hylang.org/en/latest/), looking at some of [Hy source code](https://github.com/hylang/hy), writing some Hy code using [Hy-mode](https://github.com/hylang/hy-mode) in Emacs and the nrepl (also go [Paredit](http://wikemacs.org/wiki/Paredit-mode)!). I also used the resources I added to the ["References"](/README.md#references) section.

If you're not an Emacs user there's also a Vim plugin and a Jupyter kernel for Hy!
Check [here](/README.md#tools).


### Who's the target audience?

*Tl;dr: everybody!*

My aim is to reach a wide audience whether junior or senior developers and with or without a computer science (CS) background. For example the info on Lisp and compilers are intended at more junior and non-CS people. So pick and choose what you're interested and [try out Hy](https://try-hy.appspot.com/)!
